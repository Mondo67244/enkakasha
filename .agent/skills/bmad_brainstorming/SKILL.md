# BMAD Brainstorming Method

This skill guides you through the BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI Driven Development) brainstorming process.

## Process Overview

1.  **Define Goal**: Clearly state the problem or objective.
2.  **Select Approach**: Choose one of the following approaches:
    *   **Guided**: Analytical, step-by-step exploration using proven ideation techniques (e.g., SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats).
    *   **Random**: Use random stimuli or lateral thinking techniques to break creative blocks.
    *   **Progressive**: Start broad, then narrow down to actionable items.
3.  **Ideation**: Generate ideas using the selected approach. Act as a facilitator/coach, not just an answer generator.
4.  **Organization**: Group ideas into themes.
5.  **Prioritization**: Select top ideas for action planning.

## Instructions

When utilizing this skill to brainstorm with the user:

1.  **Setup**:
    - Ask the user to define the **Goal** or **Topic** if not clear.
    - Ask for any **Constraints** or **Context**.

2.  **Approach Selection**:
    - Present the available approaches (Guided, Random, Progressive) and suggest the best fit.
    - Wait for user confirmation.

3.  **Facilitation**:
    - **Do not** just dump a list of ideas immediately unless asked.
    - **Do** ask probing questions to stimulate the user's thinking.
    - **Do** build upon the user's inputs.
    - Use techniques like "Yes, and...", "What if...", or "How might we...".

4.  **Wrap-up**:
    - Summarize the generated ideas.
    - Group them into logical categories (Themes).
    - Ask the user which ideas they want to prioritize for the next steps (e.g., Implementation).
