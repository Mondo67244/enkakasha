# 🌟 Genshin AI Mentor (Enkakasha)

[🇫🇷 Français](README_FR.md) | [🇺🇸 English](README.md)

**Genshin AI Mentor** is an advanced analysis and optimization platform for Genshin Impact. It combines the power of AI with precise data (scraped via Akasha/Enka) to help players perfect their builds.

## 🎯 What the site does

This project is divided into several interconnected modules:

*   **🔍 Build Analysis**: Uses intelligent algorithms to evaluate the quality of equipped artifacts and weapons.
*   **📊 Leaderboards & Data**: A scraping subsystem (`Tools/Scrappers`) retrieves data from top global players to establish comparison benchmarks.
*   **🤖 Mentor AI**: A virtual assistant that suggests concrete improvements based on your box and goals.
*   **📚 Visual Encyclopedia**: A local database of artifact images (generated by our tools) for a rich and responsive interface.

## 📥 Installation

**Ultra-simple "Plug & Play" Start:**

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/enkakasha.git
    cd enkakasha
    ```

2.  **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
    ✨ **Magic!** This script checks everything for you:
    *   It creates the Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist.
    *   It automatically installs dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
    *   It launches both the Backend server and Frontend site.

**(Note: Just ensure you have Python 3 and Node.js installed on your machine.)**
